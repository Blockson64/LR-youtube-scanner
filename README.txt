Line Rider YouTube Checker

This tool looks for new Line Rider videos on YouTube, checks for uploads from the last 24 hours, and logs them. It also avoids showing the same videos more than once.
Features:

    Only checks Line Rider videos from the last 24 hours.

    Saves the video title, uploader, and a short link in seen_videos.txt.

    Has a simple UI to start/stop the checker.

Setup:

    Create a folder for the project.

    Clone or download the repo into that folder.

    Install the required libraries:

    pip install yt-dlp pygame

Usage:

    Run the script:

    python main.py

    You can either use the buttons in the UI or type in the console:

        Type start to start checking.

        Type stop to stop checking.

        Type exit to quit.

The program will log the details of new videos to seen_videos.txt.
